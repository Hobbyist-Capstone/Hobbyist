# Hobbyist

Hobbyist was created during a time when many people are staying home and are out of new things to watch on their streaming services. We feel this is the perfect time to explore new hobbies or re-engage with old ones!

Hobbyist is a full stack application that allows users to keep track of the hobbies that they want to learn, and record their learning progress using the in-app hobby tracking features. Users can create a profile, follow other users, submit and rate new hobbies, and earn badges for hobbies that they have tried and loved!

This project utilizes Materialize, Javascript, FileStack API, HTML Comment Box API, jQuery, Java, MySQL, Spring Boot, and Thymeleaf.
